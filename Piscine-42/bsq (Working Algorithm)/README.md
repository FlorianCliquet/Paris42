# BSQ PROJECT

## Working Algorithm using Dynamic Programing

Hello, this is my project for the BSQ, sadly i was too concentrated on the hexdump so i haven't take times to complete the bsq. However i made the entire Algorithm, it is working and optimized but i'm not handling the file opening as it should (i'm using fopen and flines that are prohebited) and i'm not reading as it should the first line of the document. But you can adapt it to make yours better !!!
