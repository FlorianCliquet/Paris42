# FT_HEXDUMP

## WARNING

This is a really interesting solution for the moulinette, however there is an issue :
- We're not buffering everything, we display line by line and there is an issue when piping with cat -e, so you should work on it !!!
- You should send error with the basename of the executable file !

## Need help ?

If you're doing ft_hexdump right now, don't mind send me a message on github @FlorianCliquet or discord @Haatk. I would love to help you !!
