# Piscine-42

Welcome to the Piscine-42 repository! This repository contains various projects completed during the 42 school Piscine. The Piscine is an intensive programming bootcamp designed to teach the fundamentals of coding and problem-solving in a collaborative environment.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four main folders:

1. **bsq (Working Algorithm)**
2. **C (97.5%)**
3. **Rush (66%)**
4. **Shell (100%)**

Below is a brief overview of each folder and its contents.

### bsq (Working Algorithm)

The [bsq](./bsq%20(Working%20Algorithm)/) folder contains the implementation of the "Biggest Square" (BSQ) algorithm. This algorithm finds the largest possible square of empty spaces in a given 2D map filled with obstacles. The solution provided here is a working algorithm that efficiently solves the problem.

**Key Features:**
- Reads input from a file or standard input.
- Handles various map sizes and formats.
- Implements a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem in optimal time.

### C (97.5%)

The [C](./C%20(97.5%25)/) folder includes various C programming projects completed during the Piscine. These projects demonstrate proficiency in the C programming language and cover a wide range of topics and challenges.

**Overall Score:** 97.5%

### Rush (66%)

The [Rush](./Rush%20(66%25)/) folder contains projects from the "Rush" series, which are timed coding challenges that require quick thinking and efficient problem-solving. There is the solution for the 2 first.

**Overall Score:** 66%

### Shell (100%)

The [Shell](./Shell%20(100%25)/) folder includes projects related to shell scripting and command-line tools. These projects emphasize the use of Unix/Linux shell commands and scripting to automate tasks and solve problems efficiently.

**Projects:**
- **Shell 00:** Description of the first shell project.
- **Shell 01:** Description of the second shell project.
- **Shell 02:** Description of the third shell project.
- And more...

**Overall Score:** 100%
