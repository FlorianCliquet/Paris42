# Paris42DailyLog

Welcome to my Paris 42 Daily Log repository!

## Overview
This repository documents my daily progress through the 42 Piscine at 42 Paris. Each day, a new folder is added containing all the code I've written, along with a detailed README.md file summarizing my activities, learnings, challenges, and achievements.

## Structure
- Each day is represented by a folder named DayX (e.g., Day1, Day2, etc.).
- Inside each day's folder:
  - `code/`: Contains all the code written on that day.
  - `README.md`: Provides a detailed summary of tasks completed, concepts learned, challenges faced, and reflections.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Track my progress throughout the 42 Piscine program.
- Document the skills and knowledge acquired daily.
- Serve as a resource for others interested in the 42 Piscine experience.
- Reflect on my growth and learning journey.

## Navigation
- Explore each day's folder to view specific code and detailed summaries.
- Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, or questions on any day's README.md file.

Enjoy exploring my 42 Piscine journey!
