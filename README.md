# Paris42DailyLog
Welcome to Paris42DailyLog! This repository tracks my journey through the piscine of 42 Paris. Each day, I post a folder with all the code written and a README summarizing my tasks, learnings, and challenges. Follow along to see my progress, explore my work, and gain insights into the 42 Piscine experience. Feedback is welcome!
