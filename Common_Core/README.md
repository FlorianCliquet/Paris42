## Piscine Reloaded (T0)

### Objective
The Piscine Reloaded project is designed to refresh and solidify the foundational programming skills acquired during the initial Piscine bootcamp. It serves as a preparatory phase for the subsequent projects in the Common Core.

### Description
This project revisits essential C programming concepts, including basic syntax, functions, loops, and file handling. The tasks are structured to reinforce problem-solving skills and efficient coding practices.

### Key Details
- **Language:** C
- **Difficulty Level:** Beginner
- **Skills Developed:** Problem-solving, basic C syntax, file I/O

## Libft (T1)

### Objective
Libft is the first major project in the Common Core. Its purpose is to create a comprehensive library of essential C functions that will be used in future projects.

### Description
In this project, you will reimplement a set of standard C library functions, along with additional utility functions. This library will become a valuable resource for handling common tasks in C programming.

### Key Details
- **Language:** C
- **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate
- **Skills Developed:** Memory management, data structures, algorithm implementation

## Fillit (T1)

### Objective
The Fillit project aims to enhance your algorithmic skills by solving the problem of fitting Tetrimino pieces into the smallest possible square.

### Description
You will develop a program that takes a list of Tetrimino shapes and determines the smallest square in which all the pieces can fit without overlapping. This project emphasizes recursive backtracking algorithms and optimization techniques.

### Key Details
- **Language:** C
- **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
- **Skills Developed:** Recursive algorithms, optimization, problem-solving

## Get Next Line (T1)

### Objective
Get Next Line focuses on creating a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, which is a fundamental operation in many applications.

### Description
You will implement a function that reads a single line from a file descriptor, handling edge cases such as buffer management and memory leaks. This project is crucial for understanding file I/O and dynamic memory allocation in C.

### Key Details
- **Language:** C
- **Difficulty Level:** Intermediate
- **Skills Developed:** File I/O, buffer management, dynamic memory allocation
